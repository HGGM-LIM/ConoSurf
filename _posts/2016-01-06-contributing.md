The first step in contributing to the code base is forking the repo of interest:

* [ConoSurf](https://github.com/HGGM-LIM/ConoSurf/): For either ConoProbeConnector and/or SlicerPointSetProcessing
* [BiiGOptitrack](https://github.com/HGGM-LIM/BiiGOptitrack): For BiiGOptitrack

If you already have an existing fork, make sure the repo is up-to-date. Always create the branch off the actively developed branch (typically `develop` or `master`)

####For bug fixes:

* Create a branch
* Once the bug has been fixed with sufficient testing submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
* If there is an existing open issue, reference the issue number in the pull request description.

####For new features:
Open a ticket thoroughly describing the feature. The more detail you provide, the better. After at least one of core developers responds or triages the ticket and says it's a go, follow the steps:

* Create a branch
* Once implemented with tests and documentation, submit a pull request referencing the open ticket.

####For documentation:

* Create a branch or [edit the file](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flow-in-the-browser/)
* Submit a pull request
